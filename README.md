# Orbit

This is a pet project concerning celestial mechanics. Specifically, it is an integrator which generates a plot of an object orbiting another object under the influence of gravity.

There may be more to come!

## Running the script
You need to have `python3` installed, with `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. The easiest way is to install Anaconda, but whatever floats your boat.

Once you have some form of python3 installed, you can run it from the terminal or command prompt. First navigate to the folder which contains the `motion.py` file, then run:

```
python3 motion.py
```

This should generate a beautiful plot.
