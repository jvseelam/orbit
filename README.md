# Orbit

This is a pet project concerning celestial mechanics. Specifically, it is an integrator which generates a plot of an object orbiting another object under the influence of gravity.

There may be more to come!

## Running the script
You need to have `python3` installed, with `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. The easiest way is to install Anaconda, but whatever floats your boat.

If you have any questions or comments, let me know!
